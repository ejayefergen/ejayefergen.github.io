## About Me

I’m a Product Manager who found my way here through data. I enjoy understanding how systems work, spotting patterns, and turning complexity into products that feel simple and useful.

Much of my recent work sits at the intersection of product, data, and AI analytics, and I tend to gravitate toward problems where there is something new to learn.
